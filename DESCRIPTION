Description: This package provides a quick assessment of 
    goodness-of-fit for categorical response models. The 
    goFit function in particular accepts a single, multipl or 
    list of objects of class glm, vglm, clm2, polr & multinom. 
    It searches out the best model in a list of candidate 
    models based on the Akaike and the Schwarz Information 
    Criteria. It returns among others the evidence ratios, the 
    Akaike weights and the Schwarz weights of fitted models.  
    Moreover, several pseudo R-squares applicable to categorical 
    outcome models are also returned for inputed model objects. 
    The CatgoF package also includes a plotgoF function that
    graphs the the returned object of class gof.
