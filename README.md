#### Goodness-of-fit for categorical response models

## Installation
install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github("ejikeugba/CatgoF")

## Overview  
The CatgoF package is dedicated to the goodness-of-fit of categorical response models. It facilitates both assessmet and comparison of fitted models. The goFit function, in particular, supports objects of class *glm,  vglm,  clm2,  polr  &  multinom;* it extracts, computes and returns an object of class *goF* comprising of various goodness-of-fit tables. The plotgoF fuction further provides simple visualizations of the obtained measures of fit. A more detailed description of the CatgoF package is provided in the pdf and Rmd documents included in the package.
